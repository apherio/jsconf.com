## What is JSConf?

JSConf is a unique conference organization, because we aren't really a conference organization at all. We are a very loose federation of developers who share the same general idea about how a technical conference should be held.

We have been the launching point for some of the most revolutionary products, services, and technologies on the web. We have also been the inspiration point and support base for a wide range of conferences beyond the "JSConf" name.

## How Do I Update My Event?

As an organizer or support for one of our events, you may update basic information and status for your conference by updating one of two configuration files:

-  [Official JSConf Config](conferences/jsconf.yaml)
-  [JSConf Family of Events Config](conferences/family.yaml)

These config files serve the data used to build the JSConf.com website.

### Config Options

There are a few different configuration options available for you to specify:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | The key for your Yaml entry will serve as your event's ID |
| `name` | The human readable name of your conference (also used for image `alt` attributes) |
| `description` | Tell us a little about you. This field is currently not rendered on the site. |
| `site` | URL to your conference website |
| `logo` | URL to your conference logo<br><br>**NOTE:** You can add and reference locally hosted images by submitting them into the `/public/images` directory! |
| `location` | City, state or venue for your conference (i.e., **New York, NY**) |
| `status` | Optional current status of the conference. Currently, we support three different options: <ul><li>`onsale` - highlight your event with "tickets on sale"</li><li>`inactive` - hides event from view without removing it entirely</li><li>`opencfp` - highlight your event with "open call for papers"</li></ul> |

#### Status Options

The `status` config offers a couple additional variations that will dynamically
set up or remove your desired status in a more dynamic way:

**Static status declaration:**<br>
```yaml
- subterraineanjs
    status: onsale
```

**Static status declaration with an end date:**<br>
```yaml
- subterraineanjs
    status:
      - onsale:
          end: 07/01/2018
```

**Fully dynamic date range for status declaration:**<br>
```yaml
- subterraineanjs
    status:
      - onsale:
          start: 06/01/2018
          end: 07/01/2018
```

#### Example

Here is an example configuration to add in a new event that is currently on sale:

```yaml
# Subterrainean JS
- subterraineanjs:
    name: Subterrainean JS
    description: There's something great about coding underground...
    site: https://subterraineanjs.code
    logo: images/subterraineanjs.png
    location: Iceland
    status: onsale
```
